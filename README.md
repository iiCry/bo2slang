# bo2slang
A Call Of Duty Black Ops 2 sound file renamer; to be used when changing languages, as that particular task is fucking annoying thanks to the sound file part...

# Install
Easily done,
1. `git clone https://github.com/iiCry/bo2slang` or just download as zip
2. Extract or move the `bo2lang.bat` file to your BO2 directory
3. Open it up and do as instructed

That is literally it..

Also please don't run the bo2lang.bat tool in the `soundChanger` directory once done, always remember to move it back to the root; as if you don't it'll delete itself and the `lastLanguage.cry` and it won't be ***epic!***
